Initially i did not want to make this abomination to be public (ie visible to everyone), but after pondering a bit I realized that I am not a Trus. I will show my first 'coding experience'. Fun fact: believe it or not, I considered myself a genius back then for building this piece of software. 'software' is kinda a strong word here.

Technologies I used here: HTML, CSS. Pretty basic.

This is a project for my school.

This project is about my hobbies
